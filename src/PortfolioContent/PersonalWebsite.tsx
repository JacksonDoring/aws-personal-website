  <p>
    I have developed my own Personal Website for displaying and demonstrating
    skills, achievments and experience I have gained.<br></br>
    <br></br>The website was developed using <b>React(Typescript)</b>, SASS and
    Material UI. I also used <b>Github</b> to maintain versioning throughout the
    development of the project. To host the website, I used <b>AWS</b> Amplify
    and Route53. The website automatically gets updated when a commit is sent to
    the master branch<br></br>
    <br></br>Completing this project also helped me to refine my React and SASS
    skills.
