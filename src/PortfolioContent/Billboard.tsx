  <p>
    As a group at University, we developed a Billboard software that allows
    users to display, create, schedule, and modify billbaords. The software also
    included a user feature, which meant users could be created with controlled
    access to the software. We had to ensure passwords were encryped for storage
    and transportation, this was accomplised by salting and hashing the
    passwords.
